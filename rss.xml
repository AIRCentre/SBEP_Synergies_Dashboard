        <p>On 27 November 2024, the Sustainable Blue Economy Partnership hosted the ‘Blue Economy for the North Sea’ workshop in Amsterdam. This event was part of a broader series of regional workshops aimed at addressing the unique challenges and opportunities of the blue economy across the European sea basins. Organised in conjunction with the Blue Mission BANOS Arena 3 event, the workshop also explored synergies between the Partnership and the Mission Ocean.</p>
  



  
            
              
              
              
          <p>The workshop brought together senior officials and experts from policy, research, and business communities involved in the blue economy of the North Sea to share contributions and best practices. These discussions are set to inform the Partnership’s <a href="https://www.bluepartnership.eu/sites/bluepartnership.eu/files/documents/2024-12/sustainable_blue_economy_partnership_strategic_research_and_innovation_agenda_2024.pdf">Strategic Research and Innovation Agenda</a> and activities, driving forward its efforts to support a sustainable and resilient blue economy.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Key takeaways from the presentations, interactive discussion and World Café session included: &nbsp;</p><ul><li>There is a need to build a <strong>cohesive and overarching European policy to address the fragmented nature of the blue economy</strong>. With diverse policies, stakeholders, financial instruments, and regional needs, a unified framework is essential to accelerate research and innovation and impactful outcomes. &nbsp;</li><li><strong>Enhancing stakeholder connections and cooperation</strong> was also highlighted as a priority, namely between research organisations and national policymakers as well as businesses. Increased collaboration will help integrate the blue economy into the framework of the European Green Deal and the reinforced emphasis on European competitiveness, supporting key objectives such as the EU’s climate and renewable energy targets, and the economic vitality of coastal communities.</li><li>As oceans form some of Europe’s main borders, their <strong>role in security and defence</strong> is growing. It will therefore be important to position the blue economy at the heart of these conversations, aligning with the new European Commission’s focus on defence and security.</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p>

        <p>On 17 October, the Sustainable Blue Economy Partnership hosted the ‘Blue Economy for a Sustainable Black Sea’ workshop in Sofia, Bulgaria. Stakeholders from across the Black Sea region came together to provide input to the Partnership about local needs, strengths, and priorities. The event took place back-to-back with the Mission Ocean event in Burgas and the BRIDGE-BS High-Tech Summit for the Black Sea, a research forum focused on ocean digitalisation and industry in the Black Sea region. &nbsp;</p>
  



  
            
              
              
              
          <p>As part of a series of regional workshops across Europe’s sea basins, this event aimed to identify practices and regional needs relevant to the Partnership’s Strategic Research and Innovation Agenda (SRIA). These regional workshops aim to help shape policy priorities from a local perspective, whilst staying within the broader, pan-European framework of the Partnership. The workshops are organised jointly by the Partnership’s Brussels Cellule, which fosters community engagement around the Partnership, and the regional sea basin nodes that advise on strategic agendas and bridge the local and European levels, thereby creating synergies with key regional stakeholders. &nbsp;</p><p>The Black Sea workshop featured institutional speakers from the European Commission’s DG Research &amp; Innovation, DG Maritime Affairs and Fisheries, the Bulgarian government, and the Black Sea Commission, all of whom discussed policies and perspectives on regional and international scales. Representatives from research organisations also shared insights on aligning the Partnership’s goals with the Black Sea’s Strategic Research and Innovation Agenda. Industry representatives contributed perspectives on interlinking the blue economy with digital and green transitions and the role of business in applying project outcomes to the market.&nbsp;</p><p><br>The workshop comprised three panel discussions. The first panel showcased three key projects, including two funded by the Partnership’s first co-funded call for proposals (<a href="https://bluepartnership.eu/projects/improved-valorization-marine-sources-and-processing-waste-resource-efficient-blue-foodfeed">SEAREFINERY </a>and <a href="https://bluepartnership.eu/projects/waste-taste-exploring-innovative-food-applications-postharvest-fish-losses">WASTE2TASTE</a>) and a third project, MARSPLAN, financed by the European Maritime Fisheries Fund (EMFF). The creation of project portfolios, which the Partnership will organise, was highlighted as an effective way to avoid overlap and foster synergies across the initiatives. &nbsp;</p><p>The second panel explored the importance of synergies within the Black Sea region, particularly on supporting a Common Maritime Agenda and expanding international cooperation. A cross-basin dialogue session also included representatives from organisations in the Mediterranean Sea and the Baltic Sea, who provided valuable insights for collaboration.</p><p>A roundtable discussion addressed the importance the Partnership attaches to bringing project outcomes to the market by involving innovation and business communities. This session highlighted Black Sea leadership in digitalisation and sensitive technologies. &nbsp;</p><p>Finally, a world café session provided an open forum for the participants to give input to the Partnership in terms of the specific needs, priorities and challenges facing the Black Sea.</p><p>The recording of the workshop is available <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzbEMPRH77s&amp;ab_channel=%D0%91%D1%83%D1%80%D0%B3%D0%B0%D1%81%D0%BA%D0%B8%D1%81%D0%B2%D0%BE%D0%B1%D0%BE%D0%B4%D0%B5%D0%BD%D1%83%D0%BD%D0%B8%D0%B2%D0%B5%D1%80%D1%81%D0%B8%D1%82%D0%B5%D1%82">here</a>.</p><p><br>The next regional workshop will be help in Amsterdam on 27 November, focusing on the North Sea region, as part of the BlueMissionBANOS Arena 3 event.

        <p>The Partnership will add a complementary perspective to environmentally driven ocean literacy efforts by promoting the changes in behaviours and attitudes needed to enable the just and sustainable transformation of Europe’s blue economy. This can generate interest in Europe in sustainable maritime innovations, career options, investment opportunities, and generally the quest of reconciling economic development with marine ecological integrity. Industry actors will be targeted&nbsp; to help embed the&nbsp; corporate environmental responsibility needed to affect the transition. The thematic foci will be guided by the Intervention Areas and align with the EU4Ocean Coalition.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The partnership will also offer webinars about ocean literacy and communication science, and provides an ocean literacy toolkit to enable partnership beneficiaries to improve public knowledge and appreciation about their work and the opportunities in the blue economy domain.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Sustainable Blue Economy Partnership Ocean Literacy Toolkit is intended both for its funded projects and for the stakeholder community at large. The Toolkit will support integrating and enhancing ocean literacy efforts in their activities to promote the behavioural changes needed to enable the just transition to a sustainable blue economy in Europe.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>The toolkit is a collection of resources, including links to informative reports, networking platforms and initiatives on ocean literacy at the regional (EU4Ocean) and international (UN Ocean Decade) levels.</p>
